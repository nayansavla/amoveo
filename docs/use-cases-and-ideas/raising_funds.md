We can raise funds for public goods using this technology.
Unlike taxation, we don't use violence to raise funds. Amoveo doesn't cause anyone to over-pay.
Unlike donation, we don't suffer from tragedy of the commons. With Amoveo people who under-pay lose money, on average.
The most profitable strategy is to give an amount of money to the fundraiser as the public good in proportion to how much benefit it will create for you.

So if we are using the dominant assurance contract to build a bridge over a river, and the bridge will make your restaurant worth $10,000 more, then the Nash equilibrium strategy for you is to give an amount of money proportional to $10,000 to the contract.
