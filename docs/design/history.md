David Friedman showed that decentralized governance is not only economically feasible, that it is more efficient, and that it is far from dead, we use it for many parts of society every day. http://www.daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf
But we couldn't organize to make the decision to do for everything. Any organization would become a centralized institution of power. Current centralized institutions wielding power did not want to give up that power. They would decide not to use give up their power to polycentric law.

Robin Hanson showed that we can make decisions in a decentralized way, which could allow us to make the decision to use polycentric law for more parts of life. But again, the centralized institutions aren't so interested in letting us use tools that could take away their power.

So Paul Sztorc found a way to reuse technology from Bitcoin to build Robin Hanson's markets in an unstoppable way, which will allow us to make the decentralized decisions we need to start using polycentric law more often.
